Provide simple context for this model with comments or text.\n\nANSWER: \nWhen graphing the results of an epidemic, the Susceptible function always starts with a downward curve because nobody has become infected. Similarly, the Infected curve is the opposite of the Susceptible curve because, to declare a person as recovered or deceased, first they must be infected. Notice how the Infected curve has a bell shape. After this curve reaches its peak, there are one of two outcomes: recovery or death. Moreover, Recovered can be split into two parts: Recovered and Deceased. The reason is that not everyone that is infected recovers. Finally, the percentage of Recovered and Deceased must add up to 100%. After 50 days, the graph has the same four curves (S, I, R, and D) as the graph on pp. 100 of the Calculus in Context textbook, which tells us our model is correct (see graph below).",

Provide examples from your model in code blocks and context and explanation in textblocks.\n\nANSWER: By changing coefficient b, we see the number of days it takes for any given person to recover while remaining infected and contagious between Susceptible and Recovered (i.e., one sick person takes 14 days to recover equals 1/14, where b = 14). If b = 1, it only takes a person one day to recover, which means the medicine is highly effective as it cures more people, and rarely does anybody die. Similarly, the epidemic is short-lived, with S, I, R, and D only seeing slight changes, and the graph becomes flat (no new cases). To add some perspective (although hopefully not a realistic one), if it takes a person 100 days to recover (i.e., b = 100), then the Infection curve will be taller and longer lasting than the Recovered curve. In 50 days, this would be a bad scenario for medicine, as researchers would not know if there is a cure. An intermediate case would be one where an epidemic lasts 50 days (tfinal = 50), and the recovery time is also 50 days (b = 50). In this case,  the Infected and Recovered curve would reach a break-even point with a 50% chance of being either. The death rate would be considerably higher in the last two cases than in the first. To be more realistic, even at 14 days to recover, the Infection curve is still quite high, which also increases the death rate.",

Provide examples from your model in code blocks and context and explanation in textblocks.\n\nANSWER: By changing coefficient a, we determine how many contacts that occur that also lead to infections (i.e., 1 infection out of 100,000 people equals 1/100,000 = 0.00001 = a). Within a 50-day period, if coefficient a = 0.00001 (1 positive case of infection for every 100,000 people), the curves S, I, R, and D behave like the graph in pp. 100 of the Calculus Companion textbook. By decreasing coefficient a to 0.000001, we notice a slight change in rate for each curve, but not enough to consider a medical emergency. In other words, very few people become infected or die, and a few reasons for this may be herd immunity, mandated self-isolation for the time it takes to recover to avoid contaminating other individuals, or advanced medicine. On the contrary, if 3 out of 100,000 persons become infected (a = 0.00003),  the Infection curve spikes within the first 6 to 7 days. Because the number of days remains unchanged at b = 10, a high percentage of people recover at a higher rate on day 12. However, infections are also related to deaths, which means that the Deceased curve also increases. In cases with high infection rates, government mandates to stay indoors would absolutely help in flattening the infection curve, at least until a cure is found or immunity is developed.",

Answer here with code and text examples.\n\nANSWER: \n\nSimilarities: Both SIRPLOT and SIR w/ DE include the same variables--total population, Suceptible, Infected, Recovered, and beta. I have modified the SIRPLOT so that the curves have colors, and the SIR w/ DE does so, too. Moreover, the legend shows both graphs have the same-color curves--blue for Susceptible, green for Recovered, and red for Deceased, and the y-axes represent population and the x-axes days. Both implementations use appending of arrays. Both use the same Python libraries--numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. Both graphs share similar shapes for each of the curves, with the exception of deceased as it is not included in SIR w/ DE. Both use derivatives for the S, I, R-- SIRPLOT states this a Sprime, Iprime, and Rprime, while SIR w/ DE defines a function def deriv(y, t, N, beta, gamma). Moreover, on both programs the derivative formulas balance each other in that an addition of one is the subtraction of another, which results in conversation of information.\n\nDifferences: SIRPLOT assigns alpha to the percent of people that came in contact and were infected, whereas SIR w/ DE calls this value beta, and has variable gamma to show the mean recovery rate. The SIR w/ DE scales the graph in the thousands on the y-axis (and represents N = 1000 people) and from 0 to 160 days on the x-axis, while the SIRPLOT has population assigned to each of the S, I, R, D variables. Moreover, SIRPLOT includes a deaths/deceased curve that was split from the recovered curve, whereas the SIR w/ DE does not but instead has a curve for the population that recovered with immunity. As far as vectors, SIR w/ DE assignes them to a single variable, while SIRPLOT has one variable per vector. SIR w/ DE divides S, I, and R by 1000, whereas SIRPLOT does not. SIR w/ DE defines a function with differential equations, and SIPLOT uses a for loop w/o DE.",

Answer here.\n\nANSWER: Yes; the SIR with Differential Equations implementation can be used to find (a) the change in contagiousness when a person of possible contacts resulting in infections and (b) the amount of days it takes for a person to recover from an infection. The reason is that both models have the same equations, although written differently. To put it simply, SITPLOT's a = SIR w/ DE's beta, SITPLOT's I = SIR w/ DE's (I/N), and SITPLOT's (I/b) = SIR w/ DE's (gamma * I). First, if we wanted to change the equivalent of the SIRPLOT's a, we would simply input a different value for beta on SIR w/ DE. Second, if we wanted to change the equivalent of the SIRPLIT'S beta, we would change the value of gamma. For the latter, notice how the SIR w/ DE model already converts the value of gamma to a fraction (i.e., gamma = 1/10, which is equivalent to having b = 10 in SIRPLOT). Thus, both models can be used to answer Questions 2 and 3 above.",

      "source": "**Question 6:**\nHow is this implementation the same and different than SIRPLOT and the differential equation SIRmodel? Can you explore changes in the transmission coefficent and recovery rate the same way? Answer here.\n\nANSWER: \n\nSimilarities: Both SIRPLOT and SIR w/ DE explore the Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered curves. The prime equations for each of the curves balance one another in both cases. For example, SIRPLOT's Sprime = -a is its Iprime = a, and -a + a = 0. Similarly, SIRPLOT's Iprime = -(I/b) is its Rprime = (I/b), and -(I/b) + (I/b) = 0. For SIR w/ DE, dSdt = -beta is the counterpart of bIdt = beta because -beta + beta = 0, and dIdt = -(gamma * I) transfers over to dRdt = (gamma * I) because -(gamma * I) + (gamma * I) = 0. Moreover, both models share variable S for Suceptible. Thus, it is still possible to explore the changes in the transmission coefficient and recovery rate with both SIMPLOT and SIR w/ DE models.\n\nDifferences: For finding the rate of each curve, SIRPLOT uses variable names such as alpha (when contact and infection occurs) and beta (the amount of time it takes for a person to recover), whereas SIR w/ DE's equivalent of alpha is called beta and its gamma for its version beta. However, the latter gamma is actually SIRPLOT's correspondent of 1/beta. Moreover, SIRPLOT uses the unaltered variable I for the Infected curve, while SIR w/ DE divides this by population N in order to scale the y-axis range from 0 to 1.2 (representing thousands). In other words, SIRPLOT lists the total population number, whereas SIR w/ DE only shows population as a percentage. The latter may not be ideal if pharmaceutical companies need to know how much medicine to produce.",

      "source": "**SIR with Matrices**\n\n**Question 7:**\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of this matrix model?\n\nANSWER: \n\nAdvantages: SIR w/ Matrices has variables for total number of days, Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased curves, and their corresponding rate equations (rnI, rI, and rD), which are directly inputted into the matrix, saving the user time. If the user has experience with matrices, the matrix code makes clear the need to assign four 4-vector arrays to a 4x4 dynamics matrix that is then multiplied with a 4-vector representing an initial state, where every person is healthy (note that the matrix rows have to correspond to the vector columns for matrix multiplication to work). This code makes the relationship Ax = B more undertandable, where Matrix A is multiplied by vector x to result in Matrix B. Having the two for loops is less work at the time of plotting the curves than having to change three lines of code every time a change needs to be made as would be the case with SIMPLOT.\n\nDisadvantages: SIR w/ Matrix can be more complicated to understand than SIMPLOT because it does not take in variables like alpha (contact and infection) and beta (time it takes to recover from an infection) values, making it more restrictive than the SIMPLOT model. Even though the code for SIR w/ Matrix is shorter than SIMPLOT, it takes serious undertstanding of matrices to know how the program works, and where to plug in numbers to get the same results as SIMPLOT. Moreover, it may be confusing to the user to see variables within the matrix and difficult to know where they should reside for the code to work properly. Perhaps a matter of preference, showing percentage on the y-axis (i.e., aS = 1) may not be ideal when trying to mass produce a cure. Instead, a unit population number would help in determining the number of vaccines needed to slow down or stop infections. Similarly, a matter of choice, I prefer to see variables and their corresponding rates separately, and interconnected with one another through variables, as in SIMPLOT, than to have them so close together and assign an individual value of all of aS, as it could take more time to figure what they are and if they will add to 100%.",

Describe what happens to the two populations. A good way to do this is to draw graphs of the functions H(t) and L(t). It will be convenient to have the Hare scale run from 0 to 3000, and the Lynx scale from 0 to 50. If you modify the program SIRPLOT, have it plot H and 60L. You should get graphs like those above. Notice that the hare and lynx populations rise and fall in a fashion similar to the rabbits and foxes, but here they oscillate—returning periodically to their original values.\n\nANSWER: \n\nHares and lynxes share a prey-predator relationship, which is represented by equations Hprime and Lprime. First, the hare population will grow logistically if there are no lynxes because hares still face other threats, such as disease and food scarcity. Second, introduce lynxes to the ecosystem so that they prey on hares, and there will be a directly proportional relationship between both populations. For example, more hares mean more food for lynxes. However, the hare population reaches a point where it stops growing (perhaps due to lack of enough resources to keep reproducing, such as food or space) and instead decreases. Since lynxes depend on their prey for survival and since there is a directly proportional relationship between both, the lynx population also decreases. Now, hares regain population numbers with the decrease in lynxes and the now available space and food. The cycle continues and the program generates a graph with peaks (growth rate from positive to negative) and valleys (growth rate from negative to positive).",

The simplest model for me was the matrix one, although I think it is too simple to be able to find much with it. Moreover, SIRPLOT seems to both express the underlying ideas the best, as well as provide a good snapshot, of the ideas because it is the most straightforward to write and modify. Finally, incremeting the number of mathematical modeling packages can be distracting because one may focus more on making the code work than to remember what it is about.",
